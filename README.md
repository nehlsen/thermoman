# ThermoMan

_ThermoMan_ is an ESP32 project designed to regularly read the ambient temperature from a sensor and publish the value via MQTT.

**Purpose?**

I wanted to try and test some ideas related to power management on the ESP32. My Setup uses a 1000mah lipo and a small solar panel. The goal was to get this thing working 24x7 without external power.
